# Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm

This little project was done in the last year in a Soft Computing class. It was a homework to experiment these algorithms in higly complex functions.
The code presents some functions in the Fitness folders.

Currently, the code presents the Ackley, Rastringin and Rosenbrock functions.

## Dependencies

It depends on Eigen 3.3

## Building instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./softcomp
```

I'll provide more documentation later. The basic outputs are the results found for the Rastring function minimization.
